## Quick start ##

     $ git clone https://github.com/mstn/infinite-scroll-demo.git
     $ cd infinite-scroll-demo
     $ meteor add mstn:cat
     $ meteor
     
This app is intended to be used only as a demo.

## Infinite scroll with components ##

This demo is based
on the pattern [template level subscriptions](https://www.discovermeteor.com/blog/template-level-subscriptions/)
and [related example](http://meteorpad.com/pad/JNMvanxS3f4BK7S5x/Template-Level%20Subs). I did minor changes to the original logic in order to fit the api.
